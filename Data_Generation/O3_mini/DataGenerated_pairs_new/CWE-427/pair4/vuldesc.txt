The code below unsafely sets the process-wide PATH variable based on untrusted user input. It then spawns multiple threads that call an unsafe C function via libc::system. By directly installing the attacker-controlled search path into the environment and using raw pointer dereferencing for printing results, it mimics real-world uncontrolled search path element issues (CWE-427) seen in unsafe Rust usage.
