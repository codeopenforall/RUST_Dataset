This vulnerable implementation permits an XML External Entity (XXE) attack (CWE-611). When parsing an XML document that includes an external entity declaration, the program unsafely uses an unsafe block to convert a raw pointer without proper validation and subsequently opens the specified file from the file system. This may allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the server’s file system.
