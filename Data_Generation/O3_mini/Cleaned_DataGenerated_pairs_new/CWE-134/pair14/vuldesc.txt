This code demonstrates a format string vulnerability (CWE-134) by accepting a user‐supplied input and passing it directly as the format string to C’s printf via an unsafe block. Because the input is not validated or sanitized, an attacker could provide malicious format specifiers (e.g. "%x %x") that can leak memory or otherwise cause misbehavior. The vulnerability is exploited in the call to printf within the Logger::log() method.
