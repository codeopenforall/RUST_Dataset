The vulnerable code enables external entity resolution by default. When processing XML input that contains an external entity (e.g. a SYSTEM entity), the parser unsafely resolves the entity within an unsafe block by reading a hardcoded external file string ("SensitiveDataFromFile"). This mimicry of external resolution can lead to disclosure of sensitive information and represents CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entities). The use of concurrency (thread spawning) with unsafe code compounds the risk in a real-world multi-threaded environment.
