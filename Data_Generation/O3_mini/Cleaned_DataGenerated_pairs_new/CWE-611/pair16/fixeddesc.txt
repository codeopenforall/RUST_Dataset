The corrected code disables the vulnerability by inspecting the XML input for DOCTYPE declarations that contain
SYSTEM references. Upon detecting an external entity request, it immediately returns an error message instead of
attempting to resolve and include external content. This removes the unsafe behavior and prevents XXE attacks,
effectively mitigating CWE-611.
