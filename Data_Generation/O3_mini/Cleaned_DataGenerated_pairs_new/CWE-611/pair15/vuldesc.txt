This vulnerable implementation suffers from CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entities.
It fails to disable or properly restrict external entity resolution. When the input XML contains an external entity declaration,
the code unsafely spawns a thread that loads sensitive data into a global variable using unsafe Rust constructs.
This design mimics real-world vulnerabilities where external entities are resolved (e.g., accessing file:///etc/passwd),
exposing secret data.
