This corrected implementation fixes the CWE-611 vulnerability by disallowing any XML input that contains an external entity declaration.
Rather than attempting to resolve external entities via unsafe operations and concurrent threads,
it immediately rejects the input by returning a fixed error string. This approach prevents an attacker from coercing 
the application into revealing sensitive data via external entity injection.
