The corrected implementation mitigates the XXE vulnerability by completely disabling external
entity resolution. Before any processing is performed, the parser inspects the input XML for markers
like "&xxe;" or the "<!ENTITY" declaration. If any such markers are found, it immediately returns
an error rather than attempting an unsafe read of any external content. This prevents attackers from
leveraging external entity declarations to access or leak sensitive resources.
