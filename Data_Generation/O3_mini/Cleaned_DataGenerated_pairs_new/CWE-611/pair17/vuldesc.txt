This vulnerable implementation mishandles XML external entities by processing the XML input and
automatically resolving any encountered entity reference (&xxe;) using an unsafe function. The
unsafe_fetch function converts the file name to a C-style string and then reads the file without
any validation or restriction on the file path. Additionally, the use of concurrent threads to
perform the file read introduces further complexity, making the code resemble real-world unsafe
concurrent XML parsers. As a result, attackers could supply XML with malicious external entity
declarations to read local or remote files.
