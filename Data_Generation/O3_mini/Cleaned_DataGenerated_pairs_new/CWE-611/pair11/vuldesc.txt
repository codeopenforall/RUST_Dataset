This code unsafely processes XML input by allowing the resolution of external entities.
It locates an external entity declaration in the XML input and then, within an unsafe block
inside a spawned thread, it directly reads the file specified by the SYSTEM identifier.
This exposes the application to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks (CWE-611), as an attacker
could craft malicious XML to read arbitrary files.
