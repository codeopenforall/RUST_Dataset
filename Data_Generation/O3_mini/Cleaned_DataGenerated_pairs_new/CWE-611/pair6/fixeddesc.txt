In the corrected version, the XML parser is modified to detect and reject any use of external entity
declarations. Instead of resolving the entity (and thereby exposing the risk of XXE), the parser simply
returns the original XML input as-is. This eliminates the unsafe pointer manipulation and file I/O operations,
removing the external entity resolution vulnerability (CWE-611). The concurrency structure remains unchanged.
