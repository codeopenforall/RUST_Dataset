In this corrected implementation the parser’s behavior has been hardened against XXE attacks by completely 
disabling external entity resolution. Instead of blindly extracting and processing an external file referenced 
by the XML input, the code now detects the presence of an external entity and sanitizes the input by removing 
it. This eliminates the unsound use of unsafe conversions and thread-driven external file loading, ensuring 
that malicious XML inputs cannot force the application to read or process sensitive files.
