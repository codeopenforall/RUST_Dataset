This corrected code eliminates the XXE vulnerability by completely disabling external entity resolution.
Instead of attempting to extract and resolve any SYSTEM identifiers from the DOCTYPE, the process
method inspects the XML content and immediately returns an error if an external entity declaration is found.
There are no unsafe blocks or raw pointer dereferences in this version, ensuring that an attacker
cannot trigger unauthorized file reads via XML input.
