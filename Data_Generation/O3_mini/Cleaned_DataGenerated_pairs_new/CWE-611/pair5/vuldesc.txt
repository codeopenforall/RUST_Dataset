This code insecurely processes XML input by allowing external entity resolution. When a DOCTYPE
with a SYSTEM external entity declaration is detected, the code naively extracts the system
identifier and uses an unsafe function pointer dereference to call a resolver function. The
resolver function then unsafely reads the external file without proper validation or sandboxing,
thus exposing the application to XXE attacks. The use of unsafe blocks and raw pointers to a function
exacerbates the issue.
