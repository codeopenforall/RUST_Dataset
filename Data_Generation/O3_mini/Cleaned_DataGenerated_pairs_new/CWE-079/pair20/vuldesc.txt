This implementation creates HTML content by directly concatenating pre-defined header and footer with untrusted user input.
It uses an unsafe block to append the input bytes to the output buffer without any validation or HTML escaping.
This results in the raw injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code (e.g., script tags), making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-079).
