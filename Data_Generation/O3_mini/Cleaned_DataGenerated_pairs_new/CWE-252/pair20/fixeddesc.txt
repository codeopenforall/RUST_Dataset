In the corrected version the concurrent tasks now properly handle the error returned from the unsafe operation. Instead of ignoring the Result in each thread, the code immediately sends the outcome (via an mpsc channel) to the main thread. The main function then examines received errors and returns an error if any operation fails. This ensures that any failure in the unsafe block is detected and propagated, addressing the unchecked return value vulnerability seen in the previous code.
