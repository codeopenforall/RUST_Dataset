The revised code no longer accepts a user-controlled value for the search path. Instead, it uses a hard-coded, secure PATH that includes only trusted system directories. This eliminates CWE-427 by ensuring that libraries or executables are loaded only from known directories. Additionally, the unsafe conversion has been removed entirely, removing any potential memory-safety issues related to FFI-style pointer manipulation.
