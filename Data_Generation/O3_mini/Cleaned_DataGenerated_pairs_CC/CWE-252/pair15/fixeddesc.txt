In the corrected version the function no longer ignores critical error signals from the unsafe memory copy. Instead, it propagates errors returned from the unsafe block by matching on the thread’s result and the unsafe operation’s Result. This proper error handling prevents potential security issues that could arise due to unobserved failures.
