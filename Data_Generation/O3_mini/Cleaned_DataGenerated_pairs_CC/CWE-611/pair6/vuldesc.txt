This code demonstrates an insecure XML parser implementation that improperly resolves external entities.
When the XML input contains a declaration for an external entity (via SYSTEM identifier), the parser unsafely
dereferences the provided file name using an unsafe block and reads the file content without validation.
This simulates CWE-611 where external entities can be exploited to leak local file contents.
The use of raw pointer manipulation in the unsafe block, along with concurrent processing, reflects realistic
patterns seen in reported vulnerabilities.
