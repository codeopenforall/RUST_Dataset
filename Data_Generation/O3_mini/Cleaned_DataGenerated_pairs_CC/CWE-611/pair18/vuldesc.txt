The above code unsafely resolves an external XML entity defined in the DOCTYPE by using a spawned thread and an unsafe block to simulate reading a file (“secret.txt”). The unsafe block creates a raw pointer to a string literal and then converts it back to a string, bypassing Rust’s safety guarantees. This mimics an XXE vulnerability (CWE-611) where entities can be used to access sensitive external resources.
