This code is vulnerable to CWE-611 (XML External Entity Injection) because it fails to restrict the processing of external entities within XML input. When encountering the reference "&ext;", it unsafely performs a raw pointer dereference and then attempts to read external file content ("dummy.txt"). This behavior could allow an attacker to force the application to disclose sensitive file contents or perform unauthorized file accesses.
